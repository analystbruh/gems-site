                <h1>A message from our founder…</h1>
                <p class="message">Being raised in a strong community driven small-town environment, it was always embedded in me to
                    serve and give back. From my early years of assisting in daycare at church as a young teen and later
                    serving in auxiliary ministry in my adult years and as a professional volunteering in corporate employee
                    resource groups, I have and continue my desire to help others. My mother would say GEMS started
                    when I was a kid always looking out for other kids and my desire to teach. I remember during summer
                    and school breaks gathering my younger sister and neighborhood kids to “play school”. Can you
                    imagine, as a kid convincing other kids to use their break time to continue learning, chalkboard and all.
                    From my past to my present, I'm excited to share with you all where the vision of GEMS started from
                    and how it has come to be. I look forward to bringing our services to your students and providing them
                    with GEMS to help them grow and develop into their futures.</p>

                <h1>Our History</h1>
                <p class="message">“It takes a village” is a statement that is widely used in the upbringing of our kids. We all know the
                    importance of school and obtaining an education, however there is also a component of meeting the
                    kids where they are, to help them along the way. Knowing there is an area of need to help students
                    succeed, the vision for GEMS Inc. (GEMS) came to fruition and was officially established as a 501c3
                    nonprofit organization in August 2011. The vision for GEMS is to provide resources and tools for middle
                    and high school students (ages 12-18) in the areas of health, education, arts, and life skills.</p>
                <p class="message">After development of the organization structure and planning of programs, in 2014, GEMS Inc. launched
                    its first community outreach, Bay Area Family Literacy Day, providing educational resources and literary
                    works from authors, illustrators and business professionals to students and their families. Since then,
                    GEMS has partnered with city recreational departments, youth centers and other nonprofit
                    organizations to deliver enrichment programs that empower students to pursue academic goals and
                    have a positive outlook on their futures. GEMS is excited to now also offer our programs directly with
                    local schools and districts. For more information on our current programs, <a [routerLink]="'/programs'">click here</a>.</p>
