                        INVEST in YOUR FUTURE!<br><br>Have you ever heard adults say things like “Adulting is Hard”, or “I wish I
                        knew about finances when I was younger”? Well, here's an opportunity for our young people to gain
                        basic banking knowledge and how to apply finances to everyday life. In these sessions our young
                        leaders will learn how money and career aspirations align. Along with building the strategy on how to
                        obtain and manage finances to pursue academic and life goals.

                    <p>YOUR WORDS…YOUR VOICE!<br><br>SpeakLife is designed to provide an outlet for the voice of our youth to
                        be heard in a positive light! Express yourself in creative writing projects whether it's music, poetry,
                        short stories, and/or social impact topic discussions. Using your voice to engage is important not only to
                        grow communication skills but also to learn to express feelings on matters of interest and situations that
                        may impact your life from your perspective. Participants in the program will have the opportunity to
                        feature guests on our SpeakLife podcast and media productions as well as have an opportunity to
                        submit their completed SpeakLife projects for inclusion in our SpeakLife anthology publication and entry
                        to scholarship program.</p>
